Redoing this crimestats project with Springboot
and hopefully with React in the front end.

This is a learning project. 

1. I need to get the backend working first; creating some endpoints
2. learn some React to get the front-end working.
3. .... Not sure yet.

Update:
I set up swagger, and can get to the swagger pages by running the app
Then going here: http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html
Raw OpenAPI documentation: http://localhost:8080/v3/api-docs
